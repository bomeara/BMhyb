Description: The BMhyb package analyzes the phenotypic evolution of species
    of hybrid origin on a phylogenetic network. This package can detect the hybrid
    vigor effect, a burst of variation at formation, and the relative portion of
    heritability from its parents. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood.
    Users need to enter a comparative data set, a phylogeny, and information on gene
    flow leading to hybrids.
