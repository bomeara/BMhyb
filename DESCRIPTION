Description: The BMhyb package analyzes the phenotypic evolution of species
    of hybrid origin on a phylogenetic network. This package can detect a burst of variation at formation of a hybrid as well as a bias in typical hybrid values. Parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood, as well as returning regular Brownian motion parameters such as the rate of evolution and the root state.
    Users need to enter a comparative data set, a phylogeny, and information on gene
    flow leading to hybrids.
